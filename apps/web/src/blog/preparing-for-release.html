        <h1>Building Menu Book: Preparing for release</h1>
        <p>
          Why are we building a system to do this when a simple spreadsheet
          could work?
        </p>
        <p>
          The best answer is, because we could. Spreadsheets have their usage,
          but also their limitations. They work when data is logical, but fail
          when things get more complex; when you need weird conversions, recipes
          as ingredients, historical pricing changes, etc.
        </p>
        <p>This is what the Menu Book is designed to solve.</p>
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>
          These are what we as a business deemed were important to us, and why
          we built this as a system over a spreadsheet
        </p>
        <h3>Data Conversions</h3>
        <p>
          Since I built this for my own business,
          <a
            href="https://www.gobowling.co.uk/?utm_source=getmenubook&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=preparing-for-release"
            >GoBowling Shipley</a
          >, we initially did not use any system. I had started implementing
          this via a spreadsheet, but hit a simple hurdle: a loaf of bread. We
          always get the same loaf from the local supermarket; they do not offer
          the easiest nutritional data or serving sizes; everything is 100g.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is okay. I could weigh a single slice and use that as my slice
          weight. So I get the scales, weigh one —it was around 42g. That seemed
          fine until you divided the 800g loaf, which gave you around 19 slices,
          which seemed more than the eye test showed, so I weighed another 53g.
          I thought that was strange. We could try to work out an average? So I
          counted each slice, got 16, which would leave 50g per slice, give or
          take. But I counted two more loaves and each time got 16 slices, so my
          head is now thinking <code>1 loaf = 16 slices</code>, which I thought
          would be cool to write as a conversion rule visually. Still, the
          spreadsheet would not allow it; it would require things like regex to
          understand that in a <em>Ham and Cheese Sandwich</em> we would use two
          slices, which Excel fails at.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whilst this example could be written as 50g per slice, and still work.
          Take our pizzas bases, we order them in a case, they arrive as 16
          bases per case, I could weigh them as before and store them as say
          200g per base, but it seems more logical to write
          <code>1 case = 16 bases</code>, then use <code>1 base</code> inside
          the recipe so that the calculation engine can figure out the correct
          conversion rate to calculate your cost per ingredient.
        </p>
        <h3>Recipes as ingredients</h3>
        <p>
          Whilst the same as above, Excel could handle this via some
          <code>LOOKUPS</code> and <code>MATCH</code> formulas, which would
          increase the spreadsheet&#39;s complexity and require more staff to be
          Excel-literate, potentially at a cost to us. Whilst the idea of adding
          a UI to the calculator levelled the playing field, all a user would
          need is a select dropdown in a field to add a recipe as an ingredient.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take the above example, maybe all our 11&quot; pizzas have the base of
          <code>1 Base</code>, <code>60g</code> cheese, and
          <code>1 tbsp</code> of sauce. We could use that as a
          <code>Pizza Base</code> recipe, which would also have its margin
          calculated, but if we say we have a <code>Pepperoni Pizza</code>, we
          could use <code>1 Pizza Base</code>, <code>15g</code> of pepperoni,
          and, through recursive SQL calls, we could load up the full margin for
          a pepperoni pizza with minimal effort.
        </p>
        <h3>Historical Prices</h3>
        <p>
          As a business, you might want to see the effects of supply chain
          fluctuations or seasonal ingredient changes. One summer, your
          strawberries were £20 per kilo; now they are £25 per kilo; maybe they
          dropped in the off-season?
        </p>
        <p>
          Now imagine you could scroll through this, see your margin action, and
          see that during the summer season, you make 86% margin on your
          Wimbledon special, Strawberries and cream, but you only make 45% if
          you sell during the off-season. Last year you made 89%. Is it time to
          look at new suppliers, or is there a global reason you need to weather
          the storm?
        </p>
        <p>
          Historical pricing would allow you to do that. Using our MCP, you can
          link an LLM of your choice to run through your historical data to tell
          you what your data is showing you, without the need to employ your own
          data scientist. Just imagine asking ChatGPT &#39;Is my strawberry
          supplier ripping me off?&#39; and finding out in an instant
        </p>
        <h2>Questions?</h2>
        <p>
          We&#39;d love to hear from you. What recipe costing problems are you
          facing? What features would make Menu Book useful for your business?
