          <p>
            Why are we building a system to do this when a simple spreadsheet
            could work?
          </p>
          <p>
            The best answer is, because we could. Spreadsheets have their usage,
            but also their limitations. They work when data is logical, but fail
            when things get more complex; when you need weird conversions,
            recipes as ingredients, historical pricing changes, etc.
          </p>
          <p>This is what the Menu Book is designed to solve.</p>
          <h2>Features</h2>
          <p>
            These are what we as a business deemed were important to us, and why
            we built this as a system over a spreadsheet
          </p>
          <h3>Data Conversions</h3>
          <p>
            Since I built this for my own business,
            <a
              href="https://www.gobowling.co.uk/?utm_source=getmenubook&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=preparing-for-release"
              >GoBowling Shipley</a
            >, we initially did not use any system. I had started implementing
            this via a spreadsheet, but hit a simple hurdle: a loaf of bread. We
            always get the same loaf from the local supermarket; they do not
            offer the easiest nutritional data or serving sizes; everything is
            100g.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is okay. I could weigh a single slice and use that as my slice
            weight. So I get the scales, weigh one —it was around 42g. That
            seemed fine until you divided the 800g loaf, which gave you around
            19 slices, which seemed more than the eye test showed, so I weighed
            another 53g. I thought that was strange. We could try to work out an
            average? So I counted each slice, got 16, which would leave 50g per
            slice, give or take. But I counted two more loaves and each time got
            16 slices, so my head is now thinking
            <code>1 loaf = 16 slices</code>, which I thought would be cool to
            write as a conversion rule visually. Still, the spreadsheet would
            not allow it; it would require things like regex to understand that
            in a <em>Ham and Cheese Sandwich</em> we would use two slices, which
            Excel fails at.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whilst this example could be written as 50g per slice, and still
            work. Take our pizzas bases, we order them in a case, they arrive as
            16 bases per case, I could weigh them as before and store them as
            say 200g per base, but it seems more logical to write
            <code>1 case = 16 bases</code>, then use <code>1 base</code> inside
            the recipe so that the calculation engine can figure out the correct
            conversion rate to calculate your cost per ingredient.
          </p>
          <h3>Recipes as ingredients</h3>
          <p>
            Whilst the same as above, Excel could handle this via some
            <code>LOOKUPS</code> and <code>MATCH</code> formulas, which would
            increase the spreadsheet&#39;s complexity and require more staff to
            be Excel-literate, potentially at a cost to us. Whilst the idea of
            adding a UI to the calculator levelled the playing field, all a user
            would need is a select dropdown in a field to add a recipe as an
            ingredient.
          </p>
          <p>
            Take the above example, maybe all our 11&quot; pizzas have the base
            of <code>1 Base</code>, <code>60g</code> cheese, and
            <code>1 tbsp</code> of sauce. We could use that as a
            <code>Pizza Base</code> recipe, which would also have its margin
            calculated, but if we say we have a <code>Pepperoni Pizza</code>, we
            could use <code>1 Pizza Base</code>, <code>15g</code> of pepperoni,
            and, through recursive SQL calls, we could load up the full margin
            for a pepperoni pizza with minimal effort.
          </p>
          <h3>Historical Prices</h3>
          <p>
            As a business, you might want to see the effects of supply chain
            fluctuations or seasonal ingredient changes. One summer, your
            strawberries were £20 per kilo; now they are £25 per kilo; maybe
            they dropped in the off-season?
          </p>
          <p>
            Now imagine you could scroll through this, see your margin action,
            and see that during the summer season, you make 86% margin on your
            Wimbledon special, Strawberries and cream, but you only make 45% if
            you sell during the off-season. Last year you made 89%. Is it time
            to look at new suppliers, or is there a global reason you need to
            weather the storm?
          </p>
          <p>
            Historical pricing would allow you to do that. Using our MCP, you
            can link an LLM of your choice to run through your historical data
            to tell you what your data is showing you, without the need to
            employ your own data scientist. Just imagine asking ChatGPT &#39;Is
            my strawberry supplier ripping me off?&#39; and finding out in an
            instant
          </p>
          <h2>Questions?</h2>
          <p>
            We&#39;d love to hear from you. What recipe costing problems are you
            facing? What features would make Menu Book useful for your business?
