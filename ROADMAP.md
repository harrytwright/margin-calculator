This document tracks planned features and improvements for future releases.

## Future Enhancements

### Performance Optimizations (v0.3.0+)

Implement these when dataset size becomes a concern (1000+ items):

#### Pagination
- Add pagination to recipe/ingredient/supplier lists
- Default: 50 items per page
- API endpoints support `?page=1&limit=50` parameters

#### Server-Side Filtering
- Move filtering logic from client-side to API
- Add query parameters: `GET /api/recipes?search=cheese&category=sandwich&class=menu_item`
- Reduces network payload for large datasets

#### Virtual Scrolling
- Implement virtual scrolling for very long lists (1000+ items)
- Only render visible items + small buffer
- Libraries: `react-window` or `@tanstack/virtual`

#### Query Optimization
- Add database indexes on frequently filtered columns:
  - `Ingredient.category`
  - `Recipe.category`
  - `Recipe.class`
- Consider full-text search for name fields

#### Caching Strategy
- Add Redis/in-memory cache for recipe calculations
- Cache margin reports (TTL: 5 minutes)
- Invalidate on ingredient/recipe updates
